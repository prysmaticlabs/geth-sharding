# Prysmatic Labs Validator Client Implementation

This is the main project folder for a validator client implementation of Ethereum Serenity in Golang by [Prysmatic Labs](https://prysmaticlabs.com). A validator client attaches to a running beacon node in order to perform proposer/attester responsibilities and manage the lifecycle of a particular shard upon being assigned to one.
